# edison-ibeacon
Turn your intel edison into an ibeacon

This code is a python script to turn your Intel Edison into an iBeacon. 

It requires no additional libraries to the base Intel Edison Yocto distribution :)

To run the script

1. Unblock the bluetooth

$ rfkill unblock bluetooth

2. Make the script executable 

chmod +x ibeacon

3. Run it!

./ibeacon

Use ./ibeacon --help for available inputs. 


To use your ibeacon, download a suitable app such as "Locate Beacon" for iPhone or Android. Be sure to add the UUID generated by the script to the list of possible UUIDs in the Locate Beacon app in order to see your device.
